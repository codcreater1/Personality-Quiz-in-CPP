# Personality Quiz in C++

A simple console-based Personality Quiz application written in C++.  
The program asks a series of questions and classifies the user as **Introvert**, **Extrovert**, or **Ambivert** based on their answers.

This project demonstrates core C++ concepts such as:

- structs
- classes
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- vectors
- loops
- basic input/output

It is designed as a learning project and can be easily extended with more questions or personality types.
